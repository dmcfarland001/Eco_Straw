Hello,

Thank you for helping out with this project! Here are the details of the Eco Straw Dispenser,

The Eco Straw Dispenser (ESD) gives people the option to have a paper straw and think green. The paper straws will be paid for by donations. 

Here is a rundown of the project so far.

Parts:

1 Generic stepper motor


Dispenser:
Currently being modeled in Fusion 360. I'm integrating the sensor, screen and motor into the dispenser. After the model is complete I will 3D print it and we can wire up the components.


Python:

I need a GUI to run the stepper script and break beam. The two scripts I have are python 2 and 3.
